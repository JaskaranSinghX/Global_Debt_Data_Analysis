# Global_Debt_Data_Analysis
Welcome to the International Debt Analysis project! In this repository, we will analyze international debt data provided by The World Bank. This data includes both national and regional debt statistics for various countries worldwide, covering the period from 1970 to 2015.


## **Dataset Overview**

The dataset we'll be working with contains information on the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across different categories. We will explore and answer important questions such as:

Total Debt: What is the overall amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
Largest Debt Holder: Which country holds the highest amount of debt, and what is the specific value?
Average Debt: What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
